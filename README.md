# Openwrt-Devel

This repository helps create a docker container to compile and develop openwrt applications.
It downloads OpenWRT Backfire 10.03 (compatible with our Linksys devices).
If you want other version, you can edit the Dockerfile.

## Installation

### Docker installation

The installation of Docker is easy in Ubuntu 14.04 or latter. Just issue the command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

## Devel container

The following commands (1) download, install and configure the container with all tools and codes, and (2) starts the container, changing to the working directory (/home/ethanol).

```bash
docker build -t openwrt github.com/h3dema/openwrt-devel.git
docker run -w /openwrt/backfire -it openwrt
```

### Compiling the OpenWRT Backfire

#### To select packages

Use menuconfig to select the appropriate platform. The default is brcm_2_4 (for our linksys devices).
You can also use the menu to select which package will be compiled and available to install (using opkg).

```bash
make menuconfig
```

#### To compile

```bash
make -j4
```
This takes time...
The compiled firmware and packages are placed in /openwrt/backfire/bin/brcm-2.4/
